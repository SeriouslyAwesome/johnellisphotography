I studied commercial photography and graphic design at what is now Miami Ad School at Portfolio Center in Atlanta. In college, I worked as a photo assistant to photographers such as Jerry Burns, and Zach Wolfe. After graduating in 2009, I became Jay Maiselâ€™s studio manager, making prints, managing the archives, and tending to the 35,000 square-foot former bank building that served as his home, studio, and gallery.

Between 2013 and 2019, I lived on the road, traveling around the United States in an Airstream trailer with my wife, two dogs, and a cat, photographing whatever the hell I wanted. I now live in Texas.
